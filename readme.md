Brandy
======

Brandy is a tool to analyze the copy protection mechanisms from SCO Xenix and
other contemporary SCO software. This a fork of the original tool, with its goal
being to update it, to add support for modern systems, as the original developer
has abandoned all efforts to maintain it.

Brandy can:

 * Analyze encrypted files to determine the product code
 * Create new activation keys from serial number/product code pairs
 * Verify serial number/activation key pairs and extract the product code
 * Decrypt encrypted programs (without branding them)
 * Encrypt decrypted programs (without debranding them)
 * ~~Make Xenix stop crashing so much~~
 * Maybe other things, later.

Xenix is dead. Long live Xenix.
